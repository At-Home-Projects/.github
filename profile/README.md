 
At Home Projects is a small group run by middle schoolers (most are soon to be high schoolers) and is for the creation and sharing of open sorce porjects such as school projects 
and other pieces of code that can easily be recreated at home! for example, the main subject of this group is, but not limited to, Arduino. 
We are open to other project types like Raspberry Pi projects, make code arcade, Roblox, and anything else you can think of! 


For bugs reports, help, and other things, head on over to the discussions tab!
