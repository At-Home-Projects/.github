 
At Home Projects is a small group run by middle schoolers (some soon to be high schoolers) and is for the sharing of school projects. 
But also, other pieces of code that can easily be recreated at home! for example, the main subject of this group is, but not limited to, Arduino. 
We are open to other project types like Raspberry Pi projects, make code arcade, Roblox, and anything else you can think of! 
  

To join the organization DM this account on Discord. (Account coming soon)
